Guidelines for Meeting Logs
===========================

All meeting logs will be recorded in the `meeting_logs` folder of the repository. The file will be a markdown file `.md` extension.

It is nothing more than a text file with some basic markings to make it look better. Github supports markdown. Please follow the following conventions

1. File name should be in the following format - `DD-MM-YYYY-Meeting-Title.md`. Please replace the spaces with hyphens.
2. Title format: `Meeting <Sr. No.>: <Meeting Title>`
3. Subtitle format: `DD Month YYYY`
4. Please provide a small brief of the meeting with relevant details.
5. Include an ending note which contains all the outcomes of the meeting and the next meeting date and agenda.
