Meeting 1: Introduction Meeting
==========================
18 January 2016
--------------------

This meeting was to introduce all the group members and get everyone talking. We decided on the collaboration platform (github.com) and how we will communicate. Some rudimentary project ideas were discussed. Some of the ideas put forth were:

1. Online Coupon system (Finding best deals for all types of goods and services).
2. Improvising credit card authentication.
3. Faculty student interaction portal.
4. DAIICt Laptop registration portal.
5. Integrated bus pass system.
6. Collaboration portal for employees working on a project or in a team.

At the end of the meeting, we formed our discussion group and a private repository in github.com. The next meeting is scheduled on 20 January 2016, where we will discuss the project ideas.
