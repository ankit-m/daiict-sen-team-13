Guidelines for Meeting Logs

=========================================================================================================================================================================

All meeting logs will be recorded in the `meeting_logs` folder of the repository. The file will be a markdown file `.md` extension.

It is nothing more than a text file with some basic markings to make it look better. Github supports markdown. Please follow the following conventions

1. File name should be in the following format - `DD-MM-YYYY-Meeting-Title.md`. Please replace the spaces with hyphens.
2. Title format: `Meeting <Sr. No.> : <Meeting Title>`
3. Subtitle format: ' Date : DD-MM-YYYY
		      Time : Scheduled - HH:MM
		    	     Started - HH:MM
		      Venue : <Place>
		      Recorded By : <Name> (<ID>) 
4. Divide the main section into 5 Parts : 
   (i)   Agenda 
   (ii)  Brief description about the meeting
   (iii) Meeting Ended
   (iv)  Post Meeting Action Items ( Table )
   (v)   Decision Made
   (vi)  Next Meeting
5. Give enough amount of spacing so that the overall text file is readable.
